# Am I real?
This submission is for the GMTK Game Jam: Out of Control. I experimented with making the player control other characters indirectly through an in-game controller, which then is done recursively. Why not right?

Well turns out that last, recursive stage is very, very difficult, and kinda makes your brain hurt. It is possible though! Best of luck!
